# Land Suitability for Soybean Cultivation in Bavaria, Germany, using Multi-Criteria GIS Analysis

---

# 1. Abstract
The increasing need for soybeans, as well as effective agricultural land management in Europe, has encouraged the development of land suitability calculation methods. This study presents a GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to evaluate land suitability for soybean cultivation in Bavaria, Germany, supporting sustainable agricultural expansion. Seven key environmental variables, including soil pH, organic carbon, slope, drainage, land use, temperature, and precipitation, were considered for the land suitability analysis. Each criterion was weighted by a pairwise comparison using AHP and integrated to generate a weighted overlay surface. Results indicate that 14.16% of Bavaria is highly suitable for production, particularly within the central and south-central regions, while 54.89% is moderately suitable. The model’s predictive accuracy was verified through an indirect validation using Sentinel-2 NDVI imagery, achieving a 61.08% spatial overlap with highly suitable zones. This study provides an actionable decision-support tool for stakeholders to optimize soybean yields and reduce import dependency.
